# EMOCGenerator
Document generator tool to help quickly complete EMOC forms (Engineering Management of Change)

My job involves a lot of documentation for any engineering change to be made, which is common practice for many industries working with dangerous equipment or processes. Like any form, these usually have multiple fields which are either the same always (name), or should be copied accross all forms (eg. ID no, date, area).

This tool aims to improve on the current process I have for generating these forms (copy from documentation template directory, paste into target directory, manually edit) so that a windows right click context menu can be used to open the EMOCGenerator program. This program will show the simple fields which are constant accross all EMOC forms, and allow editing of all forms at once prior to their creation.

NOTE: EMOC forms removed from this Repo due to IP.
